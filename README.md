 * Questions
 Create a script that will accept two elements, the first being the two positive integer weights on
a balance scale (left and right sides) and the second element being a list of available weights as
positive integers.
The goal is to determine if you can balance the scale by using the least amount of weights from
the list, but using at most 2 weights. You can only use the available weights from the list once.
For example: if the given input is ["[5, 9]", "[1, 2, 6, 7]"] then this means there is a balance scale
with a weight of 5 on the left side and 9 on the right side. It is possible to balance this scale by
adding a 6 to the left side from the list of weights and adding a 2 to the right side. Both scales
will now equal 11 and they are perfectly balanced.
